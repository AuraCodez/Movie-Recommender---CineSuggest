# MovieRecService


#### What is this project about?
I am making a movie/book recommendation system based on the user preferences. So first the service should ask the user a few questions regarding their personal tastes such as genre and perhaps some personality questions. After that, it is going to use some algorithm or API to generate some movies or recommendations for them. But for now, I am simply just showing the most popular movies or books based on the user preferences following Spring Boot best practices such as seperation of concerns.

#### Technologies and Frameworks Used
Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Thymeleaf and Boostrap
