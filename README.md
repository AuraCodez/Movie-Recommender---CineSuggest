# MovieRecService


#### What is this project about?
I am making a movie/book recommendation system based on the user preferences. So first the service should ask the user a few questions regarding their personal tastes such as genre and perhaps some personality questions. After that, it is going to use some algorithm or API to generate some movies or recommendations for them. But for now, I am simply just showing the most popular movies or books based on the user preferences. I am following Spring Boot best practices (Controller, Service, Repository, Model) and practicing writing clean and maintainable code.

#### Technologies and Frameworks Used
Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Thymeleaf and Boostrap. Experiementing with Angular or React with the Front end.

#### Using this application
For now, there isn't a way to use the application as it is. I still need to deploy it on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.
