# MovieRecService


#### What is this project about?
I am making a movie/book recommendation system based on the user preferences. So first the service should ask the user a few questions regarding their personal tastes such as genre and perhaps some personality questions. After that, it is going to use some algorithm or API to generate some movies or recommendations for them. But for now, I am simply just showing the most popular movies or books based on the user preferences. I am following Spring Boot best practices (Controller, Service, Repository, Model) and practicing writing clean and maintainable code.

#### Current State
I am working on creating the UI of this application and also working on the logic where it asks what genre/series/actors they enjoy a lot, and then trying to narrow down to very specific movies or tv shows they may enjoy.

#### Technologies and Frameworks Used
Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB. Experiementing with React for the Front end.

#### Using this application
Planning to deploy it on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.
